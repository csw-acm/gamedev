// This is the main class, we covered what most of this was last lesson
public class MenuController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // New variable types, woo!
    



    // Here we get all our button listeners added
    // Listeners are essentially what the name implies, they wait and "listen" for a certain input
    // in the case of our button thats a mouse click
    void Start()
    {
        
    }
